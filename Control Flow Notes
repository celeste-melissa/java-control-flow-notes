IF STATEMENT
• performs a block of code if it's condition evaluates to be true.

Code Example:
  public class Main{
    public static void main(String [] args){
      int age = 25;
      if(age <18){
        System.out.println("You are unable to join.");
    }else if(age >= 18){
        System.out.println("You are welcome!");
    }
  }
}

SWITCH STATEMENT
• allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

Code Example:
public class Main{
    public static void main(String [] args){
        String day = "Pizza";
        switch(day){
            case "Sunday": System.out.println("It is Sunday.");
            break;
            case "Monday": System.out.println("It is Monday.");
            break;
            case "Tuesday": System.out.println("It is Tuesday.");
            break;
            case "Wednesday": System.out.println("It is Wenesday.");
            break;
            case "Thursday": System.out.println("It is Thursday.");
            break;
            case "Friday": System.out.println("It is Friday.");
            break;
            case "Saturday": System.out.println("It is Saturday.");
            break;
            default: System.out.println("This is not a day!");
        }
    }
}

LOGICAL OPERATORS 
• operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output.
Types of Logical Operators:
 i. && = (AND) both conditions must be true.
 ii. || = (OR) either condition must be true.
 iii. ! = (NOT) reverses the result, turns false if the result is true.

WHILE LOOPS
• executes a block of code as long as it's condition remains true.

Code Example:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String [] args){
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name = " ";
        while(name.isBlank()){
            System.out.println("What is your name?");
            name = scanner.nextLine();
        }
        System.out.println("Hello " + name);
    }
}

DO WHILE LOOP
• ensures the block of code is executed AT LEAST ONCE before the condition within the while satement is test.

Code Example:

do {
    // Statements to be executed
} while (condition);

FOR LOOP 
• executes a block of code a limited amount of times. There are three parts that must be included within
the paratheses: counter, condition, and 

Code Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i--){
            System.out.println(i);
        }
        System.out.println("HAPPY NEW YEAR");
    }
}
